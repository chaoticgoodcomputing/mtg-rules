721.1. Each station card has a striated text box and may have one or more power/toughness boxes. The text box of a station card contains one or two station symbols. Station cards also usually have the station keyword ability (see rule 702.184).

721.2. A station symbol represents a static ability. The station symbol includes a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as “{N+}.” Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a station symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of any power and toughness boxes printed within that striation, indicated here as [P/T].

721.2a “{N+}[abilities]” means “As long as this permanent has N or more charge counters on it, it has [abilities].”

721.2b “{N+}[abilities][P/T]” means “As long as this permanent has N or more charge counters on it, it has [abilities] and is a creature with base power and toughness [P/T] in addition to its other types.”

721.2c While in any zone other than the battlefield, station cards do not have power or toughness.

721.3. The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and which power/toughness box are associated with which station symbol. Station cards each contain only one text box.

721.4. Any ability a station card has that isn’t preceded by a station symbol is treated normally. In particular, each station card has its station ability (see rule 702.184) at all times. That ability may be activated regardless of how many charge counters are on it.
