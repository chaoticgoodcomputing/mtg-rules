# Magic: The Gathering: Unofficially Processed Official Rules

This repository is an automated process to track and organize the rules for the card game Magic: The Gathering

The [processed ruleset](/rules) comes from Magic's official [rules page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/rules).

I am not affiliated with Magic: The Gathering or Wizards of the Coast. I just really like processing documents.
