# Magic: The Gathering: Unofficially Processed Official Rules

This repository is an automated process to track and organize the rules for the card game Magic: The Gathering. The plaintext rules files can be found in the [`/rules`](https://github.com/chaoticgoodcomputing/mtg-rules/tree/main/rules) directory.

These rules are automatically pulled from Magic's official [rules page](https://magic.wizards.com/en/rules) whenever new ruleset updates are released.

I am not affiliated with Magic: The Gathering or Wizards of the Coast. I just really like processing documents.
